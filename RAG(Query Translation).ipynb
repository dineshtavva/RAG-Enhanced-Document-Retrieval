This decomposition allows for efficient handling of complex tasks.\\n\\n2. Subgoal Decomposition: By decomposing hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps, the agent engages in a more detailed thought process, leading to better performance on complex tasks.\\n\\n3. Reflection and Refinement: The agent engages in self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learning from mistakes and refining them for future steps. This iterative process improves the quality of final results.\\n\\n4. Memory: The agent's memory component allows it to store and retrieve information, enabling learning from past experiences and better decision-making in the future.\\n\\n5. External Classical Planner (LLM+P approach): In some cases, an external classical planner is used for long-horizon planning tasks. This involves translating the planning problem into a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), generating a PDDL plan, and translating it back into natural language.\\n\\n6. Self-Reflection and Acting Integration (ReAct): This component integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to include task-specific discrete actions and the language space. It prompts LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language, allowing for iterative improvement through self-reflection and correction of past mistakes.\\n\\nOverall, these components work together to enable the autonomous functionality of the LLM-powered agent system by facilitating task decomposition, self-improvement through reflection, and effective decision-making based on past experiences.\""

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.', metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Another quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:', metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/'}),\n",
